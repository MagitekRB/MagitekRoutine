## Installation

Magitek is a precompiled routine, which is different than some others. In order to get started as a user, follow these steps.

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/MagitekRB/MagitekRoutine/releases/latest/download/Magitek.zip).
2. Right click the zip, select properties, and check the "Unblock" option. This is necessary because the zip file includes a dll.
3. Unzip into your `RebornBuddy\Routines` folder.

Magitek automatically updates when Reborn Buddy is started, there is no need to add Magitek to an autoupdater like RepoBuddy.

## Magitek Usage

You probably also want a way to always use Magitek instead of having to pick the Routine every time you switch classes.

There are lots of options for this maintained by the community. You can use **SeleCR** which is bundled with UpdateBuddy, or you can use a plugin like **ForceMagitek**.

For convenience here is a ForceMagitek plugin that will automatically choose Magitek for you for every class. 

1. Place this [ForceMagitek.cs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MagitekRB/MagitekRoutine/master/Plugins/ForceMagitek/ForceMagitek.cs) file in the `RebornBuddy\Plugins\ForceMagitek\` folder. 
2. Then make sure to enable the plugin in RebornBuddy under the Plugins tab.

Another alternative option is to use SeleCR from https://github.com/nt153133/CarbuncleTech
